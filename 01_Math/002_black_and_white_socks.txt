This is a Pigeonhole Principle type problem. Let’s carefully think step by step:

⸻

We have:
	•	10 black socks
	•	10 white socks
	•	You can’t see while picking
	•	You need a matching pair (either 2 black or 2 white) to go out.

⸻

Worst case thinking:
	•	First pick: Suppose it’s black.
	•	Second pick: Suppose it’s white.

Now you have one black and one white. Still no usable pair.
	•	Third pick: Whatever you pick (black or white), you will now have at least two socks of the same color.

So in the worst case, you need to pick 3 socks to guarantee a matching pair. ✅

⸻

Final Answer:

3
